<a id="mbc">Memory bank controllers</a>
---

The Game Boy Advance has a 16-bit address space, the lower half of which (`$0000` – `$7FFF`), is devoted to cartridge ROM.
Further there is an a 8 kiB region (`$A000` – `$BFFF`), which is generally used for external RAM (often backed by a battery).
However, this leaves 32 kiB usable for ROM which is insufficient for most games.
This is where memory bank controllers (MBC for short, sometimes called mappers) come into play: using an MBC the allocated address space can be sliced up and swapped out.

The ROM address space is usually broken into two sections, `$0000` – `$3FFF` being a (usually) fixed mapping to the beginning of a ROM, or "bank 0", and `$4000` – `$7FFF` which can be programmatically swapped to point to other regions of ROM.
How this is handled depends on the specific MBC implementation.

Many MBCs share similar traits, namely:

- Writing a value to an address in the region `$0000` – `$1FFF` controls if external RAM is accessible. `$xA` enables access and other values disable access.
- Writing a value to an address in the region `$2000` – `$3FFF` controls which bank is swapped into the upper half of ROM address space.
- Writing a value to an address in the region `$4000` – `$5FFF` controls which bank is swapped into the external RAM address space.

None of these are universal, however. Please see the sections on the respective MBC for details.

A list of known MBC types is as follows:

### <a id="mbc-1">MBC1</a>

- Maximum ROM size: 128 banks (2 MiB) (?)
- Maximum RAM size: (?)

MBC1 is a common memory bank controller for the first few years of Game Boy games. It can be wired up to the cartridge differently sometimes giving it the illusion of being a different MBC type, usually referred to as MBC1-M. However, the physical chip is the same.

#### Bank swapping

MBC1 bank swapping is a bit unusual due to the fact that it has a high bank and a low bank that combine to make the actual bank number. The high and low bank are combined as such to arrive at the bank number for the `$4000` region bank:

`LO % MAPPING_SIZE + (HI % 4) * MAPPING_SIZE`

The bank for the `$0000` can be swapped when the MBC is "external RAM mode", which is controlled by writes to the `$6000` region. When in RAM mode, bank "0" is mapped as `(HI % 4) * MAPPING_SIZE`.

The mapping size is 32 for regular MBC1 cartridges and 16 for MBC1-M cartridges.

#### Read from `$0000` – `$3FFF`

Default mapped as bank 0. Can be swapped out with specific other banks based on "mode". See the Mapping section.

#### Read from `$4000` – `$7FFF`

Default mapped as bank 1. Can be swapped out with most other banks. See the Mapping section.

#### Read from `$A000` – `$BFFF`

External RAM. Access is disabled by default. Disabled reads are pulled high (`$FF`).

#### Write to `$0xxx` – `$1xxx`

Enable or disable external RAM access. Writing a value of `$xA` enables access, whereas any other value disables access. The high nybble is ignored (?).

#### Write to `$2xxx` – `$3xxx`

Set the low bank value; see the Mapping section. It cannot be zero and will be coerced to 1 if a value of 0 is written.

#### Write to `$4xxx` – `$5xxx`

Set the high bank value; see the Mapping section. This also controls the external RAM bank when in RAM mode.

#### Write to `$6xxx` – `$7xxx`

Adjust mode based on the least significant bit. Writing `%…1` enables "external RAM mode" which allows swapping the RAM bank and the bank at `$0000`. Writing `%…0` disables RAM mode and switches the RAM and `$0000` ROM banks back to 0.

#### Write to `$A000` – `$BFFF`

Writes a value to external RAM, if enabled. The value is ignored otherwise.

### <a id="mbc-7">MBC7</a>

MBC7 is a special memory bank controller for the Game Boy Color that contains an 2-axis accelerometer (ADXL202E) and and a 256 byte EEPROM ([93LC56](http://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/en/en010904)). It is notably used in the game Kirby's Tilt 'n' Tumble.

Accelerometer data must be latched before reading. Data is 16-bit and centered at the value `$81D0`. Earth's gravity affects the value by roughly `$70`, with larger acceleration providing a larger range. Maximum range is unknown.

Save data is accessed through a manually clocked shift register.

<a id="ppu">Picture processing unit</a>
===

The Game Boy's picture processing unit is responsible for creating video frames. One frame takes 70224 cycles (~59.7275 frames per second).

Timing is divided into 154 lines, 144 during VDraw and 10 during VBlank. Each line takes 456 cycles.

The PPU can be disabled entirely during normal operation via the [`LCDC` register](#mmio-lcdc). This prevents normal timing such that re-enabling it can lead to irregular frame rates, at least transiently.

<a name="ppu-mode">Draw modes</a>
---
The PPU has 4 distinct modes:

- Mode 0: HBlank
- Mode 1: VBlank
- Mode 2: OAM scan
- Mode 3: HDraw

Modes 0, 2, and 3 do not occur during VBlank, only during VDraw. Mode transitions occur in this order:

- 1 → 2 (VBlank to VDraw transition)
- 2 → 3 (VDraw only)
- 3 → 0 (VDraw only)
- 0 → 1 (VDraw to VBlank transition)
- 0 → 2 (VDraw only)

**Different transitions can affect timing characteristics.**

### <a name="ppu-mode-0">Mode 0</a>

HBlank occurs between lines and allows a short period of time for adjusting PPU parameters, VRAM, and OAM.

#### Timing characteristics
Base timing: 204 cycles (max)

HDraw (mode 3) can steal cycles from HBlank depending on scrolling parameters (SCX), window parameters (WX), and OAM.

### <a name="ppu-mode-1">Mode 1</a>

VBlank occurs between frames and allows a short period of time for adjusting PPU parameters, VRAM, and OAM.

#### Timing characteristics
Exact timing: 4560 cycles (10 lines)

### <a name="ppu-mode-2">Mode 2</a>

Mode 2 occurs after HBlank and before HDraw. It is used to scan OAM to find which OBJs are active. During this time OAM is locked.

#### Timing characteristics
Exact timing: 80 cycles (2 cycles per OAM entry)

### <a name="ppu-mode-3">Mode 3</a>

HDraw is when pixels are drawn.

#### Timing characteristics
Base timing: 172 cycles (min)

- 1 cycle per BG pixel
- 6–11 cycles per active OBJ
- 0–7 extra cycles: `SCX % 8`

<a id="irq">Interrupts</a>

The Game Boy contains 5 interrupt types. Each type has a different priority and vector:

| Type      | Priority | Vector  |
| --------- | -------- | ------- |
| VBlank    | 0        | `$0040` |
| LCD STAT  | 1        | `$0048` |
| Timer     | 2        | `$0050` |
| Serial    | 3        | `$0058` |
| Joypad    | 4        | `$0060` |

Interrupts are controlled through three registers:

- [`IF`](#mmio-if): interrupts asserted
- [`IE`](#mmio-ie): interrupts enabled
- `IME`: interrupt master enable

`IF` and `IE` are memory-mapped, whereas `IME` is controlled through the [`DI`](#cpu-di) (disable interrupts) and [`EI`](#cpu-ei) (enable interrupts) instructions.

Interrupt requests are edge triggered(_Is this true in all cases?_): when an IRQ is asserted, it sets the bit corresponding to its priority in the [`IF` register](#mmio-if). Interrupt *dispatch* however is level triggered: if at any time between instructions(_Unclear; which T state?_) while `IME` is enabled `IE AND IF != 0` IRQ dispatch will begin. Note that multi-M cycle instructions effectively block interrupt dispatch from starting until the end of the instruction.

Interrupt dispatch takes 4 M cycles. The interrupt vector is loaded into the program counter based on the lowest significant bit of `IE AND IF` after the program counter's old value has been pushed onto the stack, which takes two M cycles (one per byte, high byte first).

When interrupt dispatch completes the bit associated with the interrupt handled is automatically cleared from `IF` and `IME` is set to 0. Returning from the interrupt is handled by the `reti` instruction, which atomically pops the old program counter from the stack and reenables `IME`.

### <a id="irq-cancel">Interrupt dispatch canceling</a>

Interrupt dispatch is not atomic. If the value of `IE AND IF` changes between the first M cycle and when the vector is loaded, the value of the vector may change. This can happen if `IE` or `IF` is altered in some way, either by a higher priority IRQ asserting, or by another memory write (e.g. the first stack push overwriting `IE` or `IF`).

- If a higher priority IRQ is asserted, it effectively "steals" the interrupt dispatch
- If `IE AND IF` becomes zero, no interrupt vector can be located and instead `$0000` is loaded into the program counter.

- [STAT IRQ blocking](#ppu-stat-bug)
- [STAT writing IRQ](#stat-write-irq)

### <a id="ppu-stat-bug">STAT IRQ blocking</a>

The STAT IRQ is edge-triggered, based on conditions selected in the [`STAT` register](#mmio-stat). A STAT IRQ is asserted when one or more selected conditions become true when none were true previously. Trouble arises between mode transitions, because the signal doesn't go low then high again, but stays low.

For example, enabling Mode 2 and Mode 0 sources will assert an IRQ on LY 0 Mode 2, then on LY 0 Mode 0, but not on LY 1 Mode 2 since both modes are contiguous.

NB: this does not occur with Mode 0 and LYC, because LYC is slightly late on Mode 2, so the signal does go low then high again. ([Source](https://twitter.com/liji32/status/1002867726476562432))

### <a id="stat-write-irq">STAT writing IRQ</a>

When writing to STAT on DMG, bits 3–6 are considered high for one cycle, which temporarily selects all conditions and may thus assert a STAT IRQ. CGB does not exhibit this bug, even in DMG mode.
